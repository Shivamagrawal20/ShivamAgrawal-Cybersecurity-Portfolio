# Network Security Projects

## Project Overview

This section showcases practical network security projects and incident analysis completed during cybersecurity training. These projects demonstrate hands-on experience with network protocols, traffic analysis, and security incident response.

## Projects Included

### 2.1 - Analyze Network Layer Communication
- **Type**: Incident Analysis & Network Traffic Investigation
- **Skills Demonstrated**: 
  - Network protocol analysis (DNS, UDP, ICMP)
  - Traffic capture and analysis using tcpdump
  - Incident response and troubleshooting
  - DNS server security assessment
- **Key Learning**: Understanding how network protocols work and identifying service disruptions

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Network Analysis Tools
- **tcpdump**: Packet capture and analysis
- **Network analyzers**: Traffic monitoring and investigation
- **Protocol analyzers**: Deep packet inspection

### Network Protocols
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Port 53, UDP/TCP
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Connectionless communication
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Error reporting and diagnostics

### Security Incident Response
- **Incident detection**: Identifying service disruptions
- **Root cause analysis**: Determining protocol and service failures
- **Troubleshooting**: Systematic approach to network issues
- **Documentation**: Professional incident reporting

### Network Security Concepts
- **Port security**: Understanding well-known ports and services
- **Service availability**: Monitoring critical network services
- **Attack vectors**: DDoS, firewall misconfigurations
- **Network monitoring**: Proactive security measures

## Learning Outcomes

These projects provided hands-on experience in:
- Analyzing network traffic patterns
- Identifying security incidents through traffic analysis
