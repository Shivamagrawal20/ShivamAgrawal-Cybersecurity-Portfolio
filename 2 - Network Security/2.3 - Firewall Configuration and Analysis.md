## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing and optimizing firewall configurations for a financial services organization to enhance network security, improve traffic management, and ensure compliance with industry regulations. The project focused on implementing defense-in-depth strategies and establishing robust network perimeter security.

## Scenario

You are a network security engineer working for SecureBank Financial, a regional bank with 200 employees and multiple branch locations. The organization has recently upgraded their network infrastructure and needs a comprehensive firewall security assessment and configuration optimization to protect sensitive financial data and ensure regulatory compliance.

### Organization Profile
- **Industry**: Financial Services
- **Size**: 200 employees across 5 branch locations
- **Regulatory Requirements**: PCI DSS, SOX, GLBA compliance
- **Network Infrastructure**: Cisco ASA firewalls, Palo Alto Networks NGFW
- **Critical Systems**: Core banking systems, customer data, financial transactions

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Firewall Infrastructure
- **Primary Firewall**: Cisco ASA 5525-X (Headquarters)
- **Branch Firewalls**: Cisco ASA 5506-X (4 locations)
- **DMZ Firewall**: Palo Alto Networks PA-220
- **Management**: Cisco ASDM, Panorama

### Initial Assessment Findings

#### Security Configuration Issues
1. **Overly Permissive Rules**
   - 40% of firewall rules were overly broad
   - Default "allow any" rules still active
   - Insufficient logging and monitoring

2. **Network Segmentation Gaps**
   - Flat network architecture in some segments
   - Insufficient separation between critical systems
   - Guest network not properly isolated

3. **Compliance Violations**
   - Missing audit trails for financial transactions
   - Insufficient data protection controls
   - Inadequate access logging

## Firewall Security Assessment

### Phase 1: Configuration Review

#### Rule Base Analysis
**Current Rule Count**: 150+ rules across all firewalls

**Rule Categories Identified**:
- **Internet Access**: 25 rules (Web browsing, email, VPN)
- **Internal Services**: 35 rules (File sharing, printing, applications)
- **Financial Systems**: 20 rules (Core banking, transaction processing)
- **Management**: 15 rules (Administrative access, monitoring)
- **Legacy Rules**: 55 rules (Outdated, unused, overly permissive)

#### Critical Security Issues Found

1. **Rule 45: "Allow Any" Internet Access**
   ```
   Source: Internal Network (192.168.1.0/24)
   Destination: Any (0.0.0.0/0)
   Service: Any
   Action: Allow
   Logging: Disabled
   ```
   **Risk**: High - Allows unrestricted internet access
   **Impact**: Potential data exfiltration, malware downloads

2. **Rule 23: Default Administrative Access**
   ```
   Source: Any (0.0.0.0/0)
   Destination: Management Network (10.0.0.0/24)
   Service: SSH, Telnet, HTTP
   Action: Allow
   Logging: Basic
   ```
   **Risk**: Critical - Exposes management interfaces
   **Impact**: Unauthorized administrative access

3. **Rule 67: Legacy Financial System Access**
   ```
   Source: Branch Networks (172.16.0.0/16)
   Destination: Core Banking (10.10.0.0/24)
   Service: Any
   Action: Allow
   Logging: Disabled
   ```
   **Risk**: High - Overly permissive financial access
   **Impact**: Unauthorized access to banking systems

### Phase 2: Traffic Analysis

#### Network Traffic Patterns
**Analysis Period**: 30 days of firewall logs

**Key Findings**:
- **Total Traffic**: 2.5 TB processed
- **Blocked Attempts**: 15,000+ (mostly port scans, DDoS attempts)
- **Suspicious Activity**: 500+ events requiring investigation
- **Compliance Violations**: 25 instances of unauthorized access attempts

#### Traffic Distribution by Category
- **Web Traffic**: 45% (HTTP/HTTPS)
- **Email**: 20% (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- **File Transfer**: 15% (FTP, SFTP)
- **Financial Transactions**: 10% (Encrypted banking protocols)
- **Management**: 5% (SSH, SNMP, monitoring)
- **Other**: 5% (DNS, NTP, other services)

### Phase 3: Compliance Assessment

#### PCI DSS Compliance Review
**Requirements Assessed**:
- **Requirement 1**: Install and maintain firewall configuration
- **Requirement 2**: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults
- **Requirement 4**: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data
- **Requirement 10**: Track and monitor network access

**Compliance Status**: 65% compliant (Needs improvement)

**Gaps Identified**:
- Missing firewall rule documentation
- Insufficient change management procedures
- Inadequate logging and monitoring
- Weak access controls for administrative functions

## Firewall Optimization Strategy

### Security Policy Development

#### 1. Rule Base Optimization
**Objective**: Implement least-privilege access model

**New Rule Structure**:
```
Rule 1: Internet Access (Restricted)
Source: Internal Users (192.168.1.0/24)
Destination: Internet (HTTP/HTTPS only)
Service: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS
Action: Allow
Logging: Full
```

```
Rule 2: Financial System Access
Source: Authorized Workstations (192.168.1.100-150)
Destination: Core Banking (10.10.0.0/24)
Service: Specific banking protocols only
Action: Allow
Logging: Full with alerts
```

#### 2. Network Segmentation Implementation
**Segments Created**:
- **Corporate Network**: General business users
- **Financial Network**: Banking operations and transactions
- **DMZ**: Public-facing services
- **Management Network**: Administrative access
- **Guest Network**: Visitor access (isolated)
