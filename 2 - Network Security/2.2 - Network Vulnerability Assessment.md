## Project Overview

This project involved conducting a comprehensive network vulnerability assessment for a medium-sized organization to identify security weaknesses, assess network infrastructure risks, and provide actionable recommendations for improving network security posture.

## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity consultant hired by TechCorp Solutions, a growing technology company with 150 employees. The company has recently experienced several security incidents and wants to conduct a thorough assessment of their network infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen their security defenses.

### Company Infrastructure
- **Network Size**: 150 users across 3 office locations
- **Services**: Web applications, file servers, email systems, VPN access
- **Current Security**: Basic firewall, antivirus software, no formal security policies
- **Recent Incidents**: Unauthorized access attempts, suspicious network traffic, potential data exfiltration

## Assessment Methodology

### Phase 1: Network Discovery and Mapping
**Objective**: Understand the network topology and identify all network assets

**Tools Used**:
- Nmap for network scanning
- Wireshark for traffic analysis
- Network documentation review

**Key Findings**:
- 3 office locations connected via VPN
- 50+ network devices (servers, workstations, IoT devices)
- Multiple network segments with varying security levels
- Outdated network equipment in some locations

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning
**Objective**: Identify technical vulnerabilities in network infrastructure

**Scanning Strategy**:
- External network scan (Internet-facing services)
- Internal network scan (LAN infrastructure)
- Wireless network assessment
- Configuration review

**Critical Vulnerabilities Identified**:

#### High-Risk Findings
1. **Outdated Network Equipment**
   - **Issue**: Several switches and routers running firmware from 2018
   - **Risk**: Known vulnerabilities in older firmware versions
   - **Impact**: Potential for unauthorized access and network compromise

2. **Weak Wireless Security**
   - **Issue**: WPA2-PSK authentication with weak passwords
   - **Risk**: Wireless network vulnerable to brute force attacks
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized network access and data interception

3. **Unpatched Systems**
   - **Issue**: 15% of systems missing critical security patches
   - **Risk**: Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
   - **Impact**: System compromise and potential data breach

#### Medium-Risk Findings
1. **Open Network Ports**
   - **Issue**: Unnecessary services running on production servers
   - **Risk**: Increased attack surface
   - **Impact**: Potential service exploitation

2. **Weak Access Controls**
   - **Issue**: Default passwords on network devices
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized administrative access
   - **Impact**: Network configuration compromise

3. **Insufficient Network Segmentation**
   - **Issue**: Flat network architecture
   - **Risk**: Lateral movement in case of breach
   - **Impact**: Widespread system compromise

### Phase 3: Security Configuration Review
**Objective**: Assess security configurations and identify misconfigurations

**Areas Reviewed**:
- Firewall rules and policies
- Network device configurations
- Access control lists
- VPN configurations
- Wireless network settings

**Configuration Issues Found**:
- Overly permissive firewall rules
- Default configurations on network devices
- Inconsistent security policies across locations
- Weak encryption protocols in use

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix Analysis

| Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Priority |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Outdated Network Equipment | High | Critical | High | 1 |
| Weak Wireless Security | High | High | High | 2 |
| Unpatched Systems | Medium | Critical | High | 3 |
| Open Network Ports | Medium | Medium | Medium | 4 |
| Weak Access Controls | Medium | High | Medium | 5 |
| Insufficient Segmentation | Low | High | Medium | 6 |

### Business Impact Analysis
- **Financial Impact**: Potential data breach costs estimated at $500K-$2M
- **Operational Impact**: Service disruption could affect 150 employees
- **Reputational Impact**: Customer trust and business relationships at risk
- **Compliance Impact**: Potential violations of industry regulations
